# Final Project Part3

For starters, here are the link for my shorthand final presentation and final project.

After completing the second part of the assignment, I revisited and incorporated additional graphs, feeling that some were not particularly suitable for my project. This decision was influenced, in part, by observations of presenters on Tuesday who effectively utilized compelling visualizations. I tried to use some diffent types of data visulization so that my project looks more comprehensive and that the reader will not be mistaken by those graphs that looked alike. For the content of the project, I also add some personal stories in the conclusion part, and hoping that my target audience can be motiveted by mu personal exoereience.

However, the most significant change lies in my newfound exploration of shorthand as a storytelling tool. Initially hesitant due to technical challenges faced during the second part of the project, I was initially resistant to using shorthand, noting that some formatting functions appeared less user-friendly than those in PowerPoint. Yet, after dedicating some time to exploration, I discovered Shorthand's utility, enabling even those with limited artistic sensibilities, like myself, to craft visually appealing presentations. I particularly appreciate its media database, offering a selection of images, and the smooth transition between different sections.

Given that my project revolves around the dilemma of meat consumption from an environmental perspective, I want to reach two main groups of people. The first group cares a lot about helping the planet and is open to changing how they live. They're the kind of folks who want to make a positive impact on the environment. I want to share information with them that aligns with their values, helping them see how their choices, especially in what they eat, can make a real difference.

The second group is a bit different. They really like eating meat but aren't too excited about vegetables. My goal here is to show them that they can still enjoy their favorite foods while making choices that are good for the environment. I want to explain how their decisions about what they eat can actually help the planet. The project is all about making these ideas clear and showing that even small changes in what we eat can be a big win for the environment.

Even though I had some trouble collecting data because it was formatted strangely and I had to type it out manually, the experience helped me learn how to tell a good story using data visulizations. I really want my story to inspire people to learn about the topic I'm interested in and to encourage them to do something small such as changing some of their eating habit to make the world a better place.
